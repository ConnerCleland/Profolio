            As a child, I was fascinated by computers but unsure of my tech 
            path. Then, I found a free coding college program. I kept growing 
            my passion through books, online tutorials, and YouTube videos. 
            My parents, despite their non-tech backgrounds, supported me, 
            though they had intentions on me doing other subjects. Still, I stayed determined to 
            pursue my computer dreams.
